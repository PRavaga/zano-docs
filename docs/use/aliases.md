# Aliases

Each Zano user can register with an alias, for example: @easytouse, a human-readable name associated with a payment address and text comment, which is stored in the blockchain. This alias provides a short, easy-to-remember name rather than a long and confusing string of random characters. Blockchain storage ensures that aliases are protected from being altered or commandeered.

Each alias is assigned to a particular wallet. Only one alias can be created per wallet. To register an alias choose `Register an alias` from wallet main window.

To reduce possibility of phishing we set limitations on alias registrations. Users can use any combination of the lower-case Latin letters a-z and the Arabic numerals 0-9. Additionally, there is a length minimum of 6 characters, and a maximum length of 12.

The comment section will be temporarily stored in the blockchain until passing a checkpoint. For more information on pruning mechanism please refer to the [whitepaper](https://docs.zano.org/docs/whitepaper).\

Aliases can be used for more than just Zano transactions. Think of them as a decentralised address book with universal IDs that can be used for various services based on the Zano platform.
