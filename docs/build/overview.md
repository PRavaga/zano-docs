# Building with Zano

## Starting Your Development Journey

### RPC API Guide

Kickstart your journey with our RPC API Guide [Overview](rpc-api/overview.md). Here, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding from the Overview, and delve deeper into the specifics of [How to call the API](rpc-api/how-to-call-api.md). Whether your focus is on the [Daemon RPC API](rpc-api/daemon-rpc-api/get_alias_by_address.md) or the [Wallet RPC API](rpc-api/wallet-rpc-api/get_bulk_payments.md), our guide ensures clarity at every step.

If launching your own project centered around private transactions is your goal, our [Confidential Assets](confidential-assets/overview) section provides detailed methods to give your initiative a solid foundation.
